## Thank you for attending the workshop!
Our hope is that you were already able to submit your data to OBIS but often work needs to continue beyond the workshop.
This page lists some resources to help get your data the rest of the way into OBIS.

## The Standardizing Marine Bio Data Group
One of the primary goals of the "Standardizing Marine Bio Data" (SMBD) exists to provide a space for individuals to help 
each other put data into OBIS. Many from this workshop meet monthly at the SMBD and interact asynchronously to offer 
help for those aligning to DwC. There are two primary ways to interact with the SMBD:

### Monthly SMBD Meetings
Information about monthly SMBD meetings can be found on the SMBD GitHub page 
[here](https://github.com/ioos/bio_data_guide#-how-to-participate). Anyone is welcome to attend - we are a small 
community of individuals who are passionate about getting data into OBIS, DwC, other standard forms.

### SMBD GitHub Issue Tracker
You are also welcome to open an "issue" in the 
[SMBD GitHub Issue tracker](https://github.com/ioos/bio_data_guide/issues).
This issue tracker is not just for "issue reporting" - please use it to ask questions or start discussions about your 
data. 

### Add Your Dataset as an Example
You can upload your dataset into the `/datasets/` directory so that the SMBD community can learn from your work and help 
finish up any remaining work.
