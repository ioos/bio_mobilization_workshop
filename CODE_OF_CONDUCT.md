As contributors and maintainers of this project,
we pledge to follow the [Carpentry Code of Conduct][coc].

It is encouraged to read and understand the expectations 
laid out by this Code of Conduct. Some selected excerpts 
are re-stated here:

**Expected behaviour**

Everyone who participates in this workshop is required to 
conform to this Code of Conduct. It applies to all spaces 
used in the administration of this material including, but 
not limited to, virtual or in-person workshops, email lists, 
and online forums such as GitHub, Slack and Twitter. Workshop 
hosts are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code 
of Conduct. By participating, participants indicate their 
acceptance of the procedures by which The Carpentries resolves 
any Code of Conduct incidents, which may include storage and 
processing of their personal information.

All participants in our events and communications are expected to 
show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be 
professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. 
In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment 
we encourage the following kinds of behaviours:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language

* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences

* Gracefully accept constructive criticism

* Focus on what is best for the community

* Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

**Unacceptable behaviour**

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants at any Carpentries event/platform include:

* written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group

* causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation

* violent threats or language directed against another person

* the display of sexual or violent images

* unwelcome sexual attention

* nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact

* sustained disruption of talks, events or communications

* insults or put downs

* sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes

* excessive swearing

* incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm

* continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop

* publication of private communication without consent

**Consequences of Unacceptable behaviour**

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior
may be reported to any of the workshop convenors, who will assess the
incident and may determine whether to initiate a review of the
incident with a committee of workshop convenors in a manner similar to 
official Carpentries incident response workflows.
