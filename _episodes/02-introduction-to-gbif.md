== About GBIF 

[NOTE.objectives]
The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is an international network of country and organizational Participants that exists to enable free and open access to biodiversity data from all sources and to support biodiversity science, environmental research, and evidence based decision-making. 
GBIF operates as a federated system of distributed data publishing efforts, coordinated through a global informatics infrastructure and collaborative network.
In this module, you will learn more about GBIF.

=== What is GBIF?

[NOTE.presentation]
In this video (03:19) you will learn about GBIF. It is a co-production of SiB Colombia and GBIF Spain, both GBIF national nodes, with co-funding from GBIF Spain and Instituto de Investigación de Recursos Biológicos Alexander von Humboldt (IAvH).

=== Introduction to GBIF Participant Nodes

[NOTE.presentation]
Since GBIF’s founding in 2001, the participating countries and organizations have been testing and developing models for coordinating the mobilization, management and reuse of biodiversity data at the national level or within an organization’s scope. 
The formation of Participant ‘nodes’ has been central to these efforts. 
Designated by each Participant, these teams coordinate the needs and interests of the many stakeholders involved. 
In this video (07:53), we look at the variety of node models in the GBIF network to present generalized concepts relating to Participant nodes and the roles that they play in the GBIF community.

=== Countries/Economies in GBIF

[NOTE.activity]
Investigate how your country/economy is represented in GBIF

.The GBIF website has pages dedicated to countries/economies, including for countries/economies that do not yet participate in GBIF. You can use the search box on the homepage to look up a country/economy name.
image::img/web/lookupcountry.png[align="center", width="640"]

.The tabs on these pages provide a general description of the data available about the biodiversity of the country, any data published by national institutions, as well as other relevant information on the use of data by researchers in the country.

.A recent collaboration with the IUCN Invasive Species Specialist Group means that, for many countries, a checklist of introduced and invasive alien species is available from the Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (GRIIS).

****
. Look up your country on the GBIF website.
. Does your country participate in GBIF?
. How many institutions are publishing data?
. Is a list of introduced and invasive alien species available for your country?
. How well does the information available on GBIF reflect what you know about the biodiversity of your country?
