### Darwin Core - Cores and Extensions
Now that we have a firm basis for understanding the different terms in Darwin Core the next part to understand is the difference between cores and extensions. You will always have a core (occurrence core or event core) with no extensions or several. What you choose depends on the data you have and how to represent it best. The original Darwin Core core is the [occurrence core](https://tools.gbif.org/dwca-validator/extension.do?id=dwc:occurrence). Once people started using that core they began to see that they needed extensions to that core to best represent the data they were trying to share and therefore [several extensions](https://tools.gbif.org/dwca-validator/extensions.do) have been developed (and are continuing to be developed). Over time as more monitoring data has been shared there was another core type added called [event core](https://tools.gbif.org/dwca-validator/extension.do?id=dwc:event). Without getting too far into the weeds on the cores and extensions what's most important to understand is that you need to pick your core type and once you do that then you pick the extensions to go with it. For example, if your data took place as part of an event (cruise, transects, etc) you'll pick event core.

### Different options for sharing the data
#### Occurrence only
The bare minimum for sharing data to OBIS is to use the [Occurrence Core](https://tools.gbif.org/dwca-validator/extension.do?id=dwc:Occurrence) with no extensions. The occurrence core allows for providing all the required Darwin Core terms detailed in the [intro section]({{ page.root }}/01-introduction/index.html). You can produce a fully compliant Darwin Core version of the data using only the occurrence core ([see this example by Tylar Murray](https://github.com/ioos/bio_data_guide/blob/main/datasets/example_obis_minimum_flair/occurrences.csv)). On the one hand, if the data were collected using some kind of sampling methodology you will lose much of that information if you use this most simple form of the data. One the other, it is faster and easier to produce.

#### Occurrence Core + extensions
Using the occurrence core plus [relevant extensions](https://tools.gbif.org/dwca-validator/extensions.do) means that you can capture more of the data that's been recorded. As an example let's consider an environmental DNA dataset. eDNA datasets have information that is unique to that method and will not be represented well using occurrence core only. To document eDNA using Darwin Core you should follow [this guide](https://doi.org/10.35035/doc-vf1a-nr22) and you will need the occurrence core plus the [DNA derived data extension](http://rs.gbif.org/extension/gbif/1.0/dna_derived_data_2021-07-05.xml). Adding the DNA derived data extension allows you to capture information such as the PCR primer used, DNA sequences, standard operating procedure used in the assembly and other information specific to this type of data.

#### Event Core with Extended Measurement or Fact extension
An innovation that OBIS made in this space was introducing the Extended Measurement or Fact extension (also sometimes referred to as OBIS-ENV-DATA). This uses the event core with an occurrence extension + the [extended measurement or fact extension](https://tools.gbif.org/dwca-validator/extension.do?id=http://rs.iobis.org/obis/terms/ExtendedMeasurementOrFact). This extension makes it possible to include measurements for both the events (salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, gear type, etc.) as well as measurements about the occurrences (weight, length, etc.). Prior to this you were only able to include measurements of the occurrence.

### What are the **required** Darwin Core terms for publishing Event Core with Extended Measurement or Fact extension?
When doing your mapping some required information may be missing. These are the Darwin Core terms that are required to share your data to OBIS plus a few that are needed for GBIF.

> 
> | Darwin Core Term | Definition | Comment | Example |
> |------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------|
> | [`eventID`](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:eventID) | An identifier for the set of information associated with an Event (something that occurs at a place and time). May be a global unique identifier or an identifier specific to the data set.| To construct a globally unique identifier for each event (tow, quadrat, station, transect, etc) you can usually concatenate station + date but you'll need to check this is unique for each row in your data. | `INBO:VIS:Ev:00009375`<br/>`Station_95_Date_09JAN1997:14:35:00.000` <br/> `FFS-216:2007-09-21:A:replicateID1024`|
> | [`eventDate`](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:eventDate) | The date-time or interval during which an Event occurred. For occurrences, this is the date-time when the event was recorded. Not suitable for a time in a geological context. | Must follow [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).

Positive values are north of the Equator, negative values are south of it. Legal values lie between -90 and 90, inclusive. | For OBIS and GBIF the required `geodeticDatum` is WGS84. Uncertainty around the geographic center of a Location (e.g. when sampling event was a transect) can be recorded in `coordinateUncertaintyInMeters`. See more information on coordinates in the [Data Cleaning]({{ page.root }}/03-data-cleaning/index.html) section of the workshop. | `-41.0983423`  |
> | [`decimalLongitude`](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:decimalLongitude) | The geographic longitude (in decimal degrees, using the spatial reference system given in geodeticDatum) of the geographic center of a Location. Positive values are east of the Greenwich Meridian, negative values are west of it. Legal values lie between -180 and 180, inclusive | For OBIS and GBIF the required `geodeticDatum` is WGS84. See more information on coordinates in the [Data Cleaning]({{ page.root }}/03-data-cleaning/index.html) section of the workshop. | `-121.1761111` |
> | [`countryCode`](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:countryCode) | The standard code for the country in which the location occurs. | Use an [ISO 3166-1-alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) country code. Not required for OBIS but GBIF needs this for their system. | `US` |
> | [`geodeticDatum`](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwciri:geodeticDatum) | The ellipsoid, geodetic datum, or spatial reference system (SRS) upon which the geographic coordinates given in decimalLatitude and decimalLongitude as based. | Must be [WGS84](https://epsg.io/4326) for data shared to OBIS and GBIF but it's best to state explicitly that it is. | `WGS84` |

> ## Extended Measurement or Fact Extension
> Trick question. Nothing is required from the OBIS perspective but if you are using the extension `eventID` is required to be able to link the extension back to the core.

The key thing about the extended measurement or fact extension is that it provides a way to include Unique Resource Identifiers (URIs). URIs mean that if you call the measurementType "abundance" but I call it "Abundance per square meter" and we both use the measurementTypeID "http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P01/current/SDBIOL02/" then we know this is the same measurement type even if we didn't use the same free text words to describe it.

> ## Tip 
> You can search for `measurementType` that other OBIS data providers have used by using the [OBIS mof report](https://mof.obis.org/). BE CAREFUL though to make sure the
> definition in the URI matches exactly your measurement type before you reuse it for your data.

Over at the [IOOS Bio Data Guide repository](https://github.com/ioos/bio_data_guide) you can see [a script](https://github.com/ioos/bio_data_guide/blob/main/datasets/TPWD_HARC_BagSeine/TPWD_HARC_BagSeine_OBISENV.md) that was used to take data in its original form and align it to Darwin Core Event Core with Extended Measurement or Fact.

### What's in an ID?

| Darwin Core Term | Description | Example   |
|------------------|-------------|-----------|
| [eventID](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:eventID) | An identifier for the set of information associated with an Event (something that occurs at a place and time). May be a global unique identifier or an identifier specific to the data set. | `INBO:VIS:Ev:00009375`<br/>`Station_95_Date_09JAN1997:14:35:00.000` <br/> `FFS-216:2007-09-21:A:replicateID1024`|
|[occurrenceID](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:occurrenceID)|An identifier for the Occurrence (as opposed to a particular digital record of the occurrence). In the absence of a persistent global unique identifier, construct one from a combination of identifiers in the record that will most closely make the occurrenceID globally unique.|`urn:catalog:UWBM:Bird:89776` <br/> `Station_95_Date_09JAN1997:14:35:00.000_Atractosteus_spatula` <br/> `FFS-216:2007-09-21:A:replicateID1024:objectID1345330`|
|[measurementID](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:measurementID)| An identifier for the MeasurementOrFact (information pertaining to measurements, facts, characteristics, or assertions). May be a global unique identifier or an identifier specific to the data set.| `9c752d22-b09a-11e8-96f8-529269fb1459`|

IDs are the keys in your data that are used to link tables together. They are also the keys that keep track of each of the records so that if you notice a mistake or missing information you can keep the record in place in the global aggregators and fix the mistake or add the missing information. For instance, let's say you have a record with an occurrenceID `Station_95_Date_09JAN1997:14:35:00.000_Atractosteus_spatula` and after it's published to OBIS you notice that the latitude was recorded incorrectly. When you fix that record in the data you would keep the occurrenceID `Station_95_Date_09JAN1997:14:35:00.000_Atractosteus_spatula`, fix the latitude, and republish the data so that the record is still present in OBIS but you have fixed the mistake.

With that in mind what is the best way to create an eventID, occurrenceID, or measurementID? Until we have a system that mints Persistent Identififers for individual records then the best way we have seen is to build the ID from information in the data itself. That way if you need to update or fix a record you simply use the same information again to build the same ID for the same record. Take our example above `Station_95_Date_09JAN1997:14:35:00.000_Atractosteus_spatula`. This is a concatenation of information from the original source data of the Station number + Verbatim Date + Scientific name. Because this is unique for each row in the occurrence file and we have kept the original data in its original format we can always rebuild this ID by concatenating this same information together again.
