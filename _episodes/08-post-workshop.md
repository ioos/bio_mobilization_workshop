# Thank you for attending the workshop!
Our hope is that you were already able to submit your data to OBIS but often work needs to continue beyond the workshop.
This page lists some resources to help get your data the rest of the way into OBIS.

## The Standardizing Marine Bio Data Group
One of the primary goals of the "Standardizing Marine Bio Data" (SMBD) exists to provide a space for individuals to help each other put data into OBIS.
Many from this workshop meet monthly at the SMBD and interact asynchronously to offer help for those aligning to DwC.
There are two primary ways to interact with the SMBD:

### Monthly SMBD Meetings
Information about monthly SMBD meetings can be found on the SMBD github page [here](https://github.com/ioos/bio_data_guide#-how-to-participate){:target="_blank"}.
Anyone is welcome to attend - we are a small community of individuals who are passionate about getting data into OBIS, DwC, other standard forms.

### SMBD GitHub Issue Tracker
As an alternative to attending the monthly SBMD meetings anyone is welcome to open an "issue" in the [SMBD GitHub Issue tracker](https://github.com/ioos/bio_data_guide/issues){:target="_blank"}.
This issue tracker is not just for "issue reporting" - please use it to ask questions or start discussions about your data.
You can upload your dataset into the `/datasets/` directory so that the SMBD community can help as well.
