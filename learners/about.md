Marine Data Mobilization Workshop for Biology and Ecosystem Essential Ocean Variables (Bio-Eco EOV) is a Contribution to 
the UN Decade on Ocean Science for Sustainable Development and the 
[Marine Life 2030 Decade Action](https://www.oceandecade.org/resource/166/Announcement-of-the-results-of-the-first-endorsed-Decade-Actions-following-Call-for-Decade-Actions-No-012020). 
The workshop is jointly hosted by [CIOOS](https://www.cioos.ca/), [IOOS](https://ioos.noaa.gov/), Hakai, 
[MBON](http://marinebon.org/), 
[OBIS-USA](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/science-analytics-and-synthesis/obis-usa), and 
[OTN](https://oceantrackingnetwork.org/).


This workshop is a small hands-on, interactive virtual workshop focused on mobilizing marine biological observation 
datasets to the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) by helping data providers standardize their data using 
Darwin Core. This includes species observations from any type of sampling methodologies (e.g. visual surveys, net tows, 
microscopy, fish trawls, imaging, `omics, acoustics, telemetry).

The workshop will be organized based on the sections described on the 
[schedule](https://ioos.github.io/bio_mobilization_workshop/#schedule). We will spend 5 - 10 minutes presenting each 
section and then the rest of the time will be spent in breakout rooms working on your data.

# Breakout Rooms

The breakout rooms are organized into topics based on the Darwin Core mobilization activity you plan to work on. Below 
are the breakout rooms and their descriptions:
